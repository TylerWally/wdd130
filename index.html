        <p>My name is Tyler Wallentine and I am 18 years old, I lived in Gerogia before coming to BYU Idaho. </p>
        <p>One of my favorite things to do is to lift weights. It has been a favorite hobby of mine for the past year and a half, and i have enjoyed making progress in the gym.</p>
        <p>I am the second one from the left side, with glasses. I usually wear contacts though, so I may look different than this picture.</p>
